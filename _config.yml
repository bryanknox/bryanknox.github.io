# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I love software development. It makes me happy.
baseurl:
  "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog


  # `url:` is the base hostname & protocol for the site, e.g. http://example.com
  # It should be the URL to the GitHub pages.
  # This is important for the generation of:
  #   - sitemap
  #   - canonical_url
  # When the `docker-compose.yml` is used for localhost testing, this `url:` does NOT
  # appear in the generated files. Instead a localhost URL is generated using the
  # port specified in the `docker-compose.yml`.
